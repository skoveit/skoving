# Welcome to Skoving

**Skoving** is a centralized knowledge base and documentation hub for security research, software development, and decentralized systems.

Here you will find detailed documentation for my open-source projects, CTF writeups, and technical blog posts.

## Featured Project

### :fire: **PHOENIX**

**Project Nostalgia (PHOENIX)** is the flagship project documented here. It is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) Command & Control (C2) system designed to be resilient, stealthy, and secure.
